The purpose of this page is for me to discuss the services that I have deployed and are now a *critical* part of my daily life. For a full list of services check out my [[Services]] page. I have been running a homelab since 2017 so I have played with a lot of programs and have opinions about the pros and cons of all of them.

# [Quartz 4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
This website would be nothing without Quartz. It is what allows me to create a simple website from nothing other than my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes.

# [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)
Caddy is what allows me to serve multiple services from my single residential IP address. A reverse Proxy is something that everyone should play with and know how to use when starting their professional career. I have only scratched the surface of caddy and reverse proxy and hope to get better and learn more as my projects get larger and more ambitious.

# [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)
This is yet another amazing open source tool that allows me to monitor the [status of all of my services](https://status.hexadual.io/status/1) in one dashboard. It will even send me a push notification when one of my services goes offline unexpectedly. It also lets me post a message to my friends when something like the Minecraft server goes offline so I don't get bombarded with messages  of people asking `Hey is XYZ down?`.

# [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
I cant praise Syncthing enough. Its one of the longest services that I have been continuously using. Since I got my first serve. It has gotten me through both High school and now College. I have a blog post about [[Accessing all my files from every device]] using Syncthing and its a great read for anyone interested in using it.

# [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/)
About 2 years ago I gave my PiHole a list of malware and trackers to block and its been super easy to maintain as long as you update the "gravity" (horrible name). One thing that I use it for more than protection is its ability to configure local DNS records extremely easily. It allows me to enter something like `NAS.hexadual.lcl` in my address bar, file explorer and even NFS mounts.
