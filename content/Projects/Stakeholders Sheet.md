# Rhetorical situation

**Who is the author of your photojournalism article? Are you taking on a persona or assuming a future version of yourself? What are they like? How are they qualified?**

The Author of my Article will be myself. I am Personally interested in my topic so I will just try to be myself and convey my inters to the reader. I am qualified to talk about the changes at Purdue since I am a second semester senior. I have personally seen campus change over the last four years and feel qualified to talk about my experiences.

---
**What is the subject of your photojournalism article? Are there any secondary themes? Who or what is this subject like?**

The Main subject of my article is the construction across campus. One of the secondary themes that I could talk about is why there is so much construction. As well as go into details about what each project is doing.

---
**What is the genre of your project? What media and modes does it combine? How would you define this genre? How might it be circulated/published?**

The genre of my project will be an article that has pictures of some of the large and small construction sites across campus. There will then be a paragraph or two describing what is happening and why. I would define this genre as journalism since it is trying to disseminate information that is relevant to the people at and around Purdue. This article could be published electronically on a website to allow for people to see the full resolution images.

**What is your purpose as an author? You might have several of these related to the class, the scenario of the assignment, and the topic. How are they similar or different? Do any of your purpose(s) contradict?**

The Purpose that that I am pursuing for this assignment is to inform the audience of the changes that are happening around campus as well as possible driving forces that are casing these changes. I hope to help the audience, whether that be the class or the broader student body become more aware of what is happening across campus.

---
**What is the exigence of your article? Again, you might have multiple levels of these. What is the kairos (timeliness) of your article? Why is now the best time for you to be completing an article on this topic?**

The reason that I am choosing to write about the construction around campus is because there is such a large presence of construction everywhere. There is even construction across the street from where I live. The construction continues to annoy me daily. I feel that the timeliness of this article is good because of the many different big projects that are impacting the day to day on campus.

# Stakeholders & Audience
**Who is the literal audience of your photojournalism essay? Who is your target or intended audience? Who is your implied or addressed audience, if any?**

The literal audience will be the other students in class with us that I can directly share my article with. My intended audience will be the entirety of the Purdue Student body. This will also be my addressed audience as I will try to make the article describe a broad picture that can resonate with any student.

---
**What is your target audience’s relationship to your topic before reading the article? What would you like it to be after reading it? What would you like them to do or believe after reading?**

Most students on campus are aware of the construction. Its very hard to not see or hear. But I feel that many students see it as the reason that the sidewalk is closed and don’t think deeper than that. I hope that after reading students will have a deeper understanding of why Purdue is building and upgrading so much at once.

**Let’s imagine you were publishing this in The Exponent. Who would have a financial or similar interest in your article being accurate, popular, and persuasive? Why?**

If this article were published in the Exponent the financial interests that surround my topic are the landlords of different housing projects as well as the university itself. Admissions are heavily influenced by financial desires. The exponent would want the article to be as accurate and popular as possible. While if the information is not positive then the people being covered in the article will want the article to not be popular.

---
**Who might the “internal” stakeholders be for article? Who might the “external” stakeholders be? Again, imagine publishing in The Exponent if that helps make your list more concrete.**

The internal stakeholders of the article would be those that published the article. Such as the writers editors and photographers. The external stakeholders are the ones that do not have a direct interest in the articles success. Such as regular students who just read the article.
