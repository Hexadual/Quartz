# Introduction
Last updated on: `9/18/2025`
I have been tinkering with my homelab since 2017 when over that summer I built a new computer. Suddenly I had a second perfectly working computer that I didn't know what to do with. Check out my [[Homelab Evolution]] to see the work work that I have done over the years to get to where I am. 

My Goal with this project is to continuously learn by exploring and creating my own testing/working environments. As well as to experiment with new applications and projects that I find interesting. This helps me stay current and up to date with what is going on in the world of computers and technology at large.

# [[Core Services]]
Over the past 9 years I have grown very reliant on some of the services that I have deployed and created. Check out this page to see some of the services that I host and how they help me be productive and stay secure.

# [[Automation & Scripting]]
Many of my personal projects involve scripting and automating things that are tedious and would otherwise take forever. Check out this page for descriptions and documentation on all the things I automate.

# [[Projects & Experiments]]
As it says on the main page of the site. I am always working on something. Sometimes its a simple python scrip. Sometimes its a large ambitus multi month project that takes lots of time and resources. Check out this page for my thoughts on the things that I am working on or plan to work on at some point.

# [[Challenges & Lessons Learned]]
I have been tinkering with my server since 2017. In that time I have learned a lot of lessons the hard way. From not backing up data properly, to not testing before committing changes. This page acts as a repo for some of the weirdest and funniest issues that I have encountered.
