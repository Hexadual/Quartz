# Welcome
**Hi, I'm Jacob — a recent Purdue University graduate with a degree in Cybersecurity.**  
I'm passionate about technology, lifelong learning, and applying what I learn to real-world projects in my homelab. This site is where I share my thoughts, experiments, and experience—both academic and hands-on.
